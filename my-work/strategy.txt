### Strategy 

## General Knowledge
---
    - No missing values
    - About 2 million rows

## Models 

# Classical Forecasting 
---
* ARIMA
* SARIMA

# Advanced Forecasting
---
* LSTM



## Patterns

# Group Prices - ["open", "high", "low", "close"] 
    - Low magnitude (around 1)
    - Shape: "mountain"

# Group Volume - ["volume", "quote_asset_volume", "number_of_trades"] 
    - High magnitude (thousands to millions)
    - Shape: "forest"

# Taker Buy Volume - ["taker_buy_base_volume", "taker_buy_quote_volume"] 

# Target - ["target"] 


## Preprocess

# Subset Selection
---
For [Classical Forecasting] models use time-window of most recent 3-6 months
    + Avoids problems related to market regime shift 
    + Patterns may change significantly over years in the cryptomarket
